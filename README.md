## Introduction

This project is a means to cement my React skills after studying the book [The Road to Learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/) by the amazing [Robin Wieruch](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). It is actually my first ever React app.

The app is a simple dashboard to track price movements of your favorite crypto currencies. I am using the data from [cryptocompare api](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/).

My goal in this project is to try and use all the acquired learnings from the book and perhaps even go beyond.

Any feedback is welcome! Feel free to create an issue or reach out [here](https://twitter.com/GabrielMajivu).
